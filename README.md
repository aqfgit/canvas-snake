This is the first version of my first HTML5 game. Beyond the standard features, I've added a high scores board which uses local storage to keep track of the scores.

You can move the snake with the arrow keys. Unlike the normal game, running into the wall doesn't kill the snake, only when it runs into itself. This will display the "Game Over" screen, at which point you can either enter your name or be anonymous as 'Noname'. You can view the high scores at any time by pressing the 'Highscores' button. From there you are also able to go back to the main menu and start a new game.
